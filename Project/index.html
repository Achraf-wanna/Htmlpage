      <td>Hosting Heaven is a reputable and honest business. Unfortunately, it is true that there are some dodgy web hosts who will trick you into signing up with them, only to give you poor service or change the agreement later on.

      <td>PRICE AND SCALABILITY</td>
      <td>Hosting Heaven offers flexible hosting options, so you pay for exactly what you need and no more. Our hosting options allow you to upgrade seamlessly from a shared to a dedicated server as your business grows and its needs change.

Remember you will be much happier if you choose a web hosting plan that suits you exactly, rather than 'el cheapo host' claiming to offer unlimited everything for less. Ask yourself what type of customers a particular web host is going to attract if everything is for nothing. Usually these hosts attract customers that leech as much resources from the server as possible - effectively degrading the service for all other customers. See our tricks of the trade section to understand this aspect further.

In this industry, you really get what you pay for. Remember the most expensive aspect of this industry is staff who are paid to manage the technical resources and look after you as a customer.</td>

      <td>Experience is the bottom line. We began offering clients hosting in 1999.

At Hosting Heaven, our staff have decades of combined experience in UNIX/Network administration, Commercial Internet and the World Wide Web. Every member of our staff is capable of operating all of our server equipment, from simple server administration to complex customer configurations. We put this experience to work for you.

When choosing your web host, always ask how long they have been in business and is it important to you that they will be around well into the future. To understand the industry and technologies behind web hosting, they should have been around for at least 4 to 5 years.</td>
